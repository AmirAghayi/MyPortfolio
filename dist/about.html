                <p>
                    I am a passionate junior Web-Developer and programmer. I got into web-development and programming
                    about a year ago by getting into the part-time Full-stack Web-Development program at DevMountain
                    Coding School in Lehi, Utah. The program enabled me to develop a decent understanding of Javascript,
                    React.js, HTML, CSS, SASS, Node.js, SQL and MongoDB. I have developed a real passion for coding and
                    programming which is something that I anticipated due to its similarity to what I have been doing
                    for my entire life, learning and teaching languages. My 14-year teaching career has helped me be an
                    independant learner to the extent that I can proudly claim that I have taught myself more than 80%
                    of what I know about coding and programming.

                <h3>Life in Iran</h3>
                <h6>Bachelor's Degree & Getting into Teaching</h6>
                <p>I am originally from Iran. In 2005, I entered university to do my Bachelor's degree in English
                    Translation and got my first job as an ESL Teacher. I consider this to be one of the most important
                    phases of my life as it was during this time that I learned to be an independant learner and do not
                    depend on instructors and schools to learn things.</p>

                <h3>Life in Malaysia</h3>
                <h6>Master's Degree</h6>
                <p>I moved to Malaysia in 2011 in pursuit of a master's degree in TESOL. I got a scholarship at the
                    University of Nottingham and graduated in 2014. This was a really valueable experience in my life as
                    it sparked the inquisitiveness in me and taught me how to be a progressive researcher and combine
                    theory with practice. It was this ability that earned me important positions such as "The Head of R
                    & D" or "The Head of the Linguistics Department" in colleges in Malaysia.</p>

                <h3>Life in the United States</h3>
                <h6>Getting into Programming</h6>
                <p>Being an ambitious and progressive individual, I immigrated to the United States with the goal of
                    getting my PhD in TESOL and opening my own school. However, things did not go according to plan as I
                    found out that degrees from universities outside the United States, like my Degree, were not
                    accepted here in America. After doing some research, I realized the great potential in computer
                    programming and a close connection between coding and my language learning/teaching background.
                    After some extensive research I decided to enrol in a part-time Full-stack Web-Development Bootcamp
                    at one of the best coding schools in the nation called DevMountain. DevMountain introduced me to a
                    variety of topics in the field and helped me develop a decent understanding of the basics in the
                    field. I have also been able to build on the knowledge I gained through the bootcamp and develop a
                    deeper understanding of the most important areas and concepts in the field including Javascript,
                    React.js, HTML, CSS, SASS, Node.js, SQL, MongoDB etc.</p>
